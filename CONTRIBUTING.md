This repo uses the GitFlow branching model. The core concept of the GitFlow methodology is that development happens in the develop branch, but new features and functionality are created in seperate feature branches that are merged into develop when complete. Releases merge develop into master, and you can apply hotfix branches as needed during the release process.
